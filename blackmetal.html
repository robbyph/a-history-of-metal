            <h2 style="text-align: center;color: #bf0000;font-size:3.5em;">Black Metal</h2>
            <h2>Influences</h2>
                <p>Black Metal is influenced by Thrash Metal, Death Metal and, as with most forms of extreme metal, Hardcore Punk. </p>
                <p>During the 80s, several Thrash Metal and Death Metal bands, such as Slayer, Celtic Frost and Venom began to form a prototype of sorts for Black Metal.</p>

            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Black Metal doesen't care about being "Heavy". Black Metal artists want intensity and a feeling of evil. To accomplish this, most artists stay in a higher tuning such as E Standard
                or Eb Standard. Black Metal is played at a fast tempo, with very heavy distortion, usually a lo fi production and high pitch shrieked vocals. Palm Muting is very rarely used, instead 
                replaced with fast, tremolo picked riffs. There is also a huge emphasis placed on creating an atmosphere with the song, this atmosphere usually being evil. Due to this, synth pads
                are commonly used to crate this atmosphere. Production is usually very trebly, with very little regard to the bass. Also, dissonance in the composition is a must. Using Tritones and Minor
                Thirds in addition to your run of the mill power chords is a must. Black metal often strays clear of conventional song structure and usually lack clear verses and choruses. 
                Instead, many black metal songs contain lengthy and repetitive instrumental sections.</p>
                <p>Black Metal lyrics are usually seen as "evil" by the general public. Topics are usually that of anti-religion and anti-christianity. Lyrics glorifying satanism are very, very commonplace
                in this genre, leading to the disdain of clergy and concerned mothers everywhere. Misanthropy, death, war, destruction and other downtrodden lyrics are commonplace aswell. Black Metal artists
                also love to sing about natural phenomena of our world too, such as Darkness, Cold, Forests and Mountains. Lyrics about Mythology and Folklore are quite common, especially among Anti-Christian
                bands who yearn for a return to the Old Gods.</p>
                <p>Black Metal artists and fans are notable for their infatuation with the genres image and their disdain for 'Posers'. Black metal artists very often wear "corpse paint" makeup and lots of black.</p>
            <h2>Brief History</h2>
                <p>The First Wave of Black Metal arose with bands such as Bathory and Hellhammer being influenced by Proto-Black bands such as Venom and Celtic Frost. These bands were pretty much
                just "eviler" versions of thrash metal and speed metal, but weren't really different enough yet to set them apart from the rest of the scene at the time.</p>
                <p>This changed with the Second Wave of Black Metal. Mayhem guitarists, Blackthorn and Euronymous, were credited with creating the signature black metal sound, derived from Bathory.
                Fast, trebly, tremolo picked riffs became the new sound, and everyone in the scene started playing it. Bands were coming out of the woodwork, Mayhem, Emperor, Darkthrone, Nurzum,
                Immortal, Emperor, Satyricon, there are dozens more. But, in Oslo, a group of musicians who all hung out together, called themselves "The Inner Circle". Now, countless documentaries
                and books have been written about the events of The Black Circle and Helvete, so i won't tell it again, but, long story short, Dead (Mayhem lead singer) commited suicide, 
                Varg Vikernes (Bassist of Mayhem and sole member of Burzum) burned down some churches then stabbed Euronymous (Guitarist of Mayhem, and head of Deathlike Silence Records) to death. He was imprisoned for this.
                Just google "Varg Vikernes + Euronymous Murder" if you want to know more. They've made movies about this.</p>
                <p>After the death of Euronymous, Black Metal began to flourish in the metal underground all around the world. Many scenes and unique subgenres began to spring up all around the world, and black
                metal remains one of the top flavors of choice for metalheads globally.</p>
